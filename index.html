    <h1>Abstract</h1>
        
    <p>
      In the past few years, astronomers are locating and discovering many new exoplanets, which are located beyond our solar system. 
      These planets all have different sizes, masses, and types, and some are even predicted to sustain life! 
      Despite these revolutionary findings, not much information is widely known about these exoplanets, which is mainly because they have obscure names 
      – random strings of letters and numbers – so it makes it very difficult to look them up and learn about them.
       Moreover, it is hard to visualize the sizes and distances of these celestial bodies from just a table, leading to a need for comprehensive yet 
       informative data visualizations to present these findings not only for public or educational access, but also for scientists in this field to 
       stay up-to-date and explore different trends. Our full paper is linked here: <a href='https://github.com/DS4200-S22/final-project-exoplanet-visualization/blob/main/paper/Research_Paper.pdf'> Full Paper </a>

  <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>
  
  <p>
    This visual allows the user to create visual connections between radius and mass compared to eccentricity. Additionally, the user can hover their mouse over any individual point to reveal specific information on the exoplanet. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Scatterplots: </strong>
    Show the relationship between quantitative data, and the different colors represent the years of discovery.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Filter: </strong>
    The user can control the upper bounds of both eccentricity plots. To change the upper bound, click the vertical arrows to the right of the number representing the upper bound. We created this feature to allow the user to filter the data down into a more approachable subsection.  
  </p>
    <strong>Brushing and Linking: </strong>
    By clicking and dragging on either of the eccentricity plots, you will select a grouping of planets that is linked to the adjacent plot. To deselect a group of planets, click anywhere on the plot.  
  
  <p>
    <strong>Tool Tip: </strong>
    Each exoplanet has information covering its name, radius, mass, orbital period, eccentricity, and discovery year. By hovering over an individual point a tool tip covering this information pops up. To get rid of a tool tip, move the mouse off of an exoplanet's data point.
