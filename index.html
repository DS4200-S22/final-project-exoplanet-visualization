    <h1>Abstract</h1>
        
    <p>
      In the past few years, astronomers are locating and discovering many new exoplanets, which are located beyond our solar system. 
      These planets all have different sizes, masses, and types, and some are even predicted to sustain life! 
      Despite these revolutionary findings, not much information is widely known about these exoplanets, which is mainly because they have obscure names 
      – random strings of letters and numbers – so it makes it very difficult to look them up and learn about them.
       Moreover, it is hard to visualize the sizes and distances of these celestial bodies from just a table, leading to a need for comprehensive yet 
       informative data visualizations to present these findings not only for public or educational access, but also for scientists in this field to 
       stay up-to-date and explore different trends.
